Unify D3D9 texture mod codebase (streaming, reload, in-game compare UI) with
D3D11 mod tools.


Work licensing terms for third-party add-ons / plug-ins into project so that
installation of these components (i.e. ReShade, dgVoodoo) can be simplified for
the end-user.

Finish Vulkan API support, right now framerate limiting and counting is in but
without a UI to display this information it's pretty useless ;)


### Continue work on license terms to protect myself from what happened on
GitHub. (I will be a repeated target of fraudulent terms-of-service violations.)
